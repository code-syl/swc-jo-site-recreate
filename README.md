# swc-jo-site-recreate
A rewrite and recreate of a Jedi Order (SWCombine) sister faction website from 2004.

The goal of the project was to lift the website to the 2022s, while still having that 2004 vibe. The 
challenge was to not use any javascript.

The website has also been altered to be responsive on mobile.

The original site and files can be found in `/legacy`.

## Technologies

The site was built in IntelliJ IDEA, and written in primarily HTML5. The styling is done in SCSS, which was compiled into raw CSS.
