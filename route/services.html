                Raw materials that are extracted from any point in the galaxy are the life-blood of it.
                Without the minerals that are extracted, industry in the galaxy from the most massive
                juggernauts to the smallest personal projects would seize up and lie lifeless. As such,
                mining groups such as the Banvhar Combine are constantly at work, extracting a
                bewildering array of resources for usage in every imaginable application. Here is a
                listing of what we currently offer in the way of RM sales.

                Datacards hold the information of the galaxy as we know it. As such, they are commonly
                guarded closely, and treated with great respect amongst any who possess them.
                Whether they contain the plans to a Super Star Destroyer or a simple hold out blaster,
                you will always find some measure of protection regarding what many people consider
                their secrets. Some information is commonly available and found in many places, but
                other bits can be harder to locate, and can cost many credits to come by. As such,
                Banvhar Combine treats rentals with respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Datacard rentals are available for all that wish to use them save for the Imperial
                Union, the Sith, any organization or individual considered to be a criminal to the
                Jedi Order, and any affiliates.
            </p>
            <P>
                The cost of a datacard is a set rate indicated below the item. Datacards
                are not something we generally post on the Centrepoint page, as we prefer to deal
                with people on a more personal level when it comes to development. From time to time
                we have ships or vehicles that are not part of our modest line up of goods, those too
                can be found on Centerpoint Market. All DC prices are final.

            <p>
                Construction is one of the main industries in the Galaxy, and can be a very
                time-consuming and expensive process. It ranges in scale from a simple fountain to
                entire star systems being managed by hardworking sentient beings. The resources
                often involved in such tasks can easily overwhelm someone who is either on a budget
                or short on time. To this end we offer our workers, ships, skill, and time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our rate situations for Construction are as follows. To help cover costs we use
                a tiered rate system. It is added to the end of a job in addition to any costs
                incurred while building (materials, labor). We do not charge for the hiring of
                workers, as we already have an ample workforce. For information concerning city
                or planet design, contact Russ Leman.

                In the galaxy there are many tasks that require someone who specializes in them.
                Tasks such as these are often complex and require years of training to begin to utilize
                the benefits provided by such work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mining in the modern galaxy is one such task that frequently requires dedicated
                individuals that spend their lives extracting and refining the materials necessary to
                support a growing galactic community. Banvhar Combine has a team of specialists that
