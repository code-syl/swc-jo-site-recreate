 <a name="sales"><h3>Raw Material Sales</h3></a>

 <section>

 <p id="default">Raw materials that are extracted from any point in the galaxy are the life-blood of it. Without the minerals that are extracted, industry in the galaxy from the most massive juggernaughts to the smallest personal projects would sieze up and lie lifeless. As such, mining groups such as the Banvhar Combine are constantly at work, extracting a bewildering array of resources for usage in every imagineable application. Here is a listing of what we currently offer in the way of RM sales.</p>

 <p id="default"><a href="http://tinyurl.com/79gsuae">Datacards</a> hold the information of the galaxy as we know it. As such, they are commonly guarded closely, and treated with great respect amongst any who possess them. Whether or not they contain the plans to a Super Star Destroyer or a simple hold out blaster, you will always find some measure of protection regarding what many people consider their secrets. Some information is commonly available and found in many places, but other bits can be harder to locate, and can cost many credits to come by. As such, Banvhar Combine treats rentals with respect. Datacard rentals are available for all that wish to use them save for the Imperial Union, the Sith, any organization or individual considered to be a criminal to the Jedi Order, and any affiliates. The cost of a datacard is a set rate indicated on the table to the right. Datacards are not something we generally post on the Centrepoint page, as we prefer to deal with people on a more personal level when it comes to development. From time to time we have ships or vehicles that are not part of our modest line up of goods, those too can be found on Centerpoint Market. All DC prices are final.</p>

 <a name="build"><h3>Construction Services</h3></a>

 <p id="default">Construction is one of the main industries in the Galaxy, and can be a very time consuming and expensive process. It ranges in scale from a simple fountain to entire star systems being managed by hard working sentient beings. The resources often involved in such tasks can easily overwhelm someone who is either on a budget or short on time. To this end we offer our workers, ships, skill, and time. Our rate situations for Construction are as follows. To help cover costs we use a tiered rate system. It is added to the end of a job in addition to any costs incurred while building (materials, labor). We do not charge for the hiring of workers, as we already have an ample workforce. For information concerning city or planet design, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/k24whoh">contact Russ Leman.</a></p>

 <table border="1" align="left">
  <tr>
   <th>Tier</th><th>Slabs</th><th>Add-on</th>

  <tr>
   <td>First</td>
   <td>1-3</td>
   <td>15%</td>

  <tr>
   <td>Second</td>

 <p id="default">Instance 1 - We provide everything. It is as stated, we provide everything. Banvhar Combine in this instance would be reimbursed construction, datacard, and raw material costs, adding on the tiered rate provided here.</p>

 <p id="default">Instance 2 - You provide raw materials. In this instance, we would charge only for construction costs, datacard fees, and/or partial materials costs (depending on whether you provided some or all RM's required). The tiered rate would be added to the end as in the 1st instance.</p>

 <p id="default">Instance 3 - You provide everything and you just need a worker. In this instance, we can dispatch someone speedily to tend to your construction needs, and would charge 50k/day that they are on site building in addition to any other fees accrued.</p>

 <a name="manage"><h3>Management Services</h3></a>

 <p>In the galaxy there are many tasks that require someone who specializes in them. Tasks such as these are often complex and require years of training to begin to utilize the benefits provided by such work. Mining in the modern galaxy is one such task that frequently requires dedicated individuals that spend their lives extracting and refining the materials necessary to support a growing galactic community. Banvhar Combine has a team of specialists that can optimize your yields and help create a maximum return on your investment. Whether you wish to devlop cities, build armadas, or just push the raw along for some credits, our team will prove more than competent in every aspect of the job. Basic extraction management rate is double extraction. This covers salaries, transport, maintenance, and all other costs associated with extracting your raw materials. No matter what material it is, we will get it done.</p>
